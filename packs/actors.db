As a cleric, your chants generally invoke your deity and their powerful servants by name or title, while your gestures are followed by sacred symbols or other representations of your deity.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the common spells on the divine spell list or from other divine spells to which you gain access and learn via Learn a Spell. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a cleric, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in Cleric Spells per Day table above.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are or for your enemies to roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Wisdom, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<h2>Heightening Spells</h2>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks.</p>\n<h2>Cantrips</h2>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of cleric spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level cleric, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level cleric, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p>"},"rules":[{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"override","path":"spellcasting.templates.cleric.tradition","priority":33,"value":"divine"},{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"override","path":"spellcasting.templates.cleric.spells.main.slug","priority":33,"value":"main"},{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"override","path":"spellcasting.templates.cleric.spells.main.type","priority":33,"value":"prepared"},{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"override","path":"spellcasting.templates._folder","priority":23,"value":"folder"},{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"override","path":"spellcasting.templates.cleric._folder","priority":23,"value":"folder"},{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"override","path":"spellcasting.templates.cleric.tradition._folder","priority":23,"value":"folder"},{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"override","path":"spellcasting.templates.cleric.spells._folder","priority":23,"value":"folder"},{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"override","path":"spellcasting.templates.cleric.spells.main._folder","priority":23,"value":"folder"}],"slug":"cleric-spellcasting","_migration":{"version":0.915,"lastMigration":null,"previous":{"schema":0.911,"foundry":"11.315","system":"5.12.7"}},"traits":{"otherTags":[],"value":["cleric"],"rarity":"common"},"publication":{"title":"Pathfinder Player Core","authors":"","license":"ORC","remaster":true},"level":{"value":1},"category":"classfeature","onlyLevel1":false,"maxTakable":1,"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"prerequisites":{"value":[]},"location":"w6RWQ8AxPIJMrLfD"},"type":"feat","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.AvNbdGSOTWNRgcxs"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":100,"ownership":{"default":0,"ApUWqKmznC38Ruq2":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"5.11.3","coreVersion":"11.315","createdTime":1702907679723,"modifiedTime":1702907679723,"lastModifiedBy":"ApUWqKmznC38Ruq2"},"_id":"OAeEyiRrslcMXWZq"},{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/deity.webp","name":"Deity (Abadar)","system":{"description":{"gm":"","value":"<p>As a cleric, you are a mortal servitor of a deity you revere above all others. Your deity grants you the trained proficiency rank in one skill and with the deity's favored weapon. If the favored weapon is uncommon, you also get access to that weapon.</p>\n<p>Your deity also adds spells to your spell list. You can prepare these just like you can any spell on the divine spell list once you can prepare spells of their rank as a cleric. Any of these spells that aren't normally on the divine list are still divine spells if you prepare them this way.</p>\n<h2>Sanctification</h2>\n<p>Depending on your deity, their sanctification can make you holy or unholy. This gives you the holy or unholy trait, which commits you to one side of a struggle over the souls of the planes and may be referenced in other abilities. If you \"can be\" holy or unholy according to your deity, you make that choice, and if you \"must be\" holy or unholy you gain the trait automatically. If you gain the opposing trait in some way, you lose the previous trait until you complete an atone ritual.</p>\n<h2>Anathema</h2>\n<p>Acts fundamentally opposed to your deity's ideals are anathema to your faith. Learning or casting spells, committing acts, and using items that are anathema to your deity remove you from your deity's good graces.</p>\n<p>Casting spells with the unholy trait is almost always anathema to deities who don't allow unholy sanctification, and casting holy spells is likewise anathema to those who don't allow holy sanctification. Similarly, casting spells that are anathema to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your connection to your deity. For example, casting a spell to create undead would be anathema to Pharasma, the goddess of death. Many actions that are anathema don't appear in any deity's formal list. For borderline cases, you and your GM determine which acts are anathema.</p>\n<p>If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. The class features that you lose are determined by the GM, but they likely include your divine font and all cleric spellcasting. These abilities can be regained only if you repent by conducting an atone ritual.</p>"},"rules":[{"choices":{"filter":[{"or":["item:category:deity","item:category:pantheon"]}],"itemType":"deity"},"flag":"deity","key":"ChoiceSet","predicate":[{"not":"deity"}],"prompt":"PF2E.SpecificRule.Prompt.Deity","selection":"Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.d56paSkcwvll2OhR"},{"allowDuplicate":false,"key":"GrantItem","predicate":[{"not":"deity"}],"uuid":"{item|flags.pf2e.rulesSelections.deity}","flag":"abadar"},{"adjustName":false,"choices":[{"label":"PF2E.TraitHoly","predicate":[{"or":["deity:primary:sanctification:can:holy","deity:primary:sanctification:must:holy"]}],"value":"holy"},{"label":"PF2E.TraitUnholy","predicate":[{"or":["deity:primary:sanctification:can:unholy","deity:primary:sanctification:must:unholy"]}],"value":"unholy"},{"label":"PF2E.NoneOption","predicate":[{"nor":["deity:primary:sanctification:must:holy","deity:primary:sanctification:must:unholy"]}],"value":"none"}],"key":"ChoiceSet","predicate":[{"nor":["deity:primary:sanctification:none","sanctification:holy","sanctification:unholy"]}],"prompt":"PF2E.SpecificRule.Prompt.Sanctification","rollOption":"sanctification","slug":"sanctification","flag":"sanctification","selection":"holy"},{"add":["holy"],"key":"ActorTraits","predicate":["sanctification:holy"]},{"add":["unholy"],"key":"ActorTraits","predicate":["sanctification:unholy"]},{"fist":true,"key":"Strike","predicate":["deity:primary:favored-weapon:fist"]},{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"upgrade","path":"flags.pf2e.favoredWeaponRank","predicate":["class:cleric"],"value":1}],"slug":"deity","_migration":{"version":0.915,"lastMigration":null,"previous":{"schema":0.911,"foundry":"11.315","system":"5.12.7"}},"traits":{"otherTags":[],"value":["cleric"],"rarity":"common"},"publication":{"title":"Pathfinder Player Core","authors":"","license":"ORC","remaster":true},"level":{"value":1},"category":"classfeature","onlyLevel1":false,"maxTakable":1,"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"prerequisites":{"value":[]},"location":"w6RWQ8AxPIJMrLfD"},"type":"feat","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.DutW12WMFPHBoLTH"},"pf2e":{"itemGrants":{"abadar":{"id":"wfLcRxzibYZrZImm","onDelete":"detach"}}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":200,"ownership":{"default":0,"ApUWqKmznC38Ruq2":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"5.11.3","coreVersion":"11.315","createdTime":1702907679723,"modifiedTime":1702907679723,"lastModifiedBy":"ApUWqKmznC38Ruq2"},"_id":"MxF3l6YZh20nmjJJ"},{"img":"icons/magic/symbols/question-stone-yellow.webp","name":"Doctrine","system":{"description":{"gm":"","value":"<p>Even among followers of the same deity, approaches vary.
