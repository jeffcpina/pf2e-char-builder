            <div><span>Pathfinder is a roleplaying game based on an older version of D</span><span>&amp;</span><span>D (namely 3.5).</span></div>
            <div><span>It is uniquely different from D&amp;D in the following manner:</span></div>
            <div><span></span></div>
            <ul>
                <li><span>It uses critical hit-and-miss more often.</span></li>
                <li><span>Fighter roles are more defined and efficient as a front-end characters than spellcasters</span></li>
                <li><span>Spellcasters are defined as more supportive and less blaster or melee style.</span></li>
                <li><span>Some spellcasters use prepared spells, where spells and levels are set in advance.</span></li>
                <li><span>Feats are used more often. There are Class, Ancestry, skill, and general feats.</span></li>
                <li><span>Better controlled melee using stats that accurately reflect your skill and your opponent.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p><span>So before we get started, let's think of a character you want to play:</span><span></span></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Shaolin monk who needs to prove his prowess before returning to the monastery</li>
                <li>Champion fighter who is set to right a wrong that has fallen upon his world</li>
                <li>Apprentice wizard who would like to establish his own stature in a new community</li>
                <li>Bard who is looking for tales that he can set to music and establish his fame in the world.</li>
            </ul>
